    INSTRUCTIONS:
        Create a method that will reverse the phrase that is sent to it.
    HINT:
        * method name should be called 'reversePhrase'
        * think about what type of argument is passed to it; what type of data
            does it pass back to the caller
        * the tests are currently commented out because they are configured to call the
            reversePhrase method (which doesn't exist until you create it)
            * go into AlDervezTest and uncomment the tests to validate your code; you
            may want to uncomment only the first test and work through the problem
            before uncommenting the rest of the tests
    EXAMPLE:
            |   INPUT             | OUTPUT                          |
            |-------------------------------------------------------|
            | Hello There         |  erehT olleH                    |
            |-------------------------------------------------------|
