            INSTRUCTIONS:
                * The user (driver) will call this method with a number; the method will determine what prize,
                    if any, has been won
                * if number is divisible by 5, return "You won a car!"
                * if number is divisible by 2, return "You won a mouse!"
                * if number is divisible by 3, return "You won a house!!"
                * any other number, return "You lost, play again"

            HINT:
                * Good time to use the modulus operator (look it up)
                * this is a self-testing method; it does not run by itself;
                    it's called by a test method (it's kinda like a driver)

            EXAMPLE:
       
                |   INPUT     | OUTPUT                     |
                |------------------------------------------|
                | 30          |  "You won a car!"             |
                |------------------------------------------|
