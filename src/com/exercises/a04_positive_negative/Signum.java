            INSTRUCTIONS:
                * Modify the method so that it can determine wether the parameter passed to it
                    is positive, negative or unsigned

            HINT:
                * this is a self-testing method; it does not run by itself;
                * to run go to the SignumTest class and run it (Ctrl-Shft-F10)
                    - it's executed by a test method (it's kinda like a driver)
                    - all tests should pass
                    - zero should return "unsigned"

            EXAMPLE:

                |   INPUT     | OUTPUT                     |
                |------------------------------------------|
                | -234         |  "negative"               |
                | 18734        |  "positive"               |
                |------------------------------------------|
