            INSTRUCTIONS:
                Maria has written a method to generate a greeting to whoever calls the method (e.g. "Hola Patricia!")
                The method returns a greeting depending on who the sender (based on the 'name'
                input).  However, she wants to send a special message to her crush Johnny but send a completely
                different one to her nemesis Emily.

            EXAMPLE:

                1)  if the caller is "gonzalo"
                     return ==> "Hola Gonzalo!"
         
                 2)  if the name is "JuanCho" o "Juancho" o "juancho"
                             return ==> "Hola mi amorcito!!"
                 3)  if the name is "Emilia" o "emilia"
                             return ==> "Quien eres? No te conozco!"
